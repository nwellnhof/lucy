=head1 NAME

Lucy::Index::SegReader - Single-segment IndexReader.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $polyreader = Lucy::Index::IndexReader->open(
        index => '/path/to/index',
    );
    my $seg_readers = $polyreader->seg_readers;
    for my $seg_reader (@$seg_readers) {
        my $seg_name = $seg_reader->get_seg_name;
        my $num_docs = $seg_reader->doc_max;
        print "Segment $seg_name ($num_docs documents):\n";
        my $doc_reader = $seg_reader->obtain("Lucy::Index::DocReader");
        for my $doc_id ( 1 .. $num_docs ) {
            my $doc = $doc_reader->fetch_doc($doc_id);
            print "  $doc_id: $doc->{title}\n";
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SegReader interprets the data within a single segment of an index.

Generally speaking, only advanced users writing subclasses which manipulate
data at the segment level need to deal with the SegReader API directly.

Nearly all of SegReader’s functionality is implemented by pluggable
components spawned by L<Architecture|Lucy::Plan::Architecture>’s
factory methods.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_seg_name

    $seg_reader->get_seg_name();

Return the name of the segment.

=head2 get_seg_num

    $seg_reader->get_seg_num();

Return the number of the segment.

=head2 del_count

    $seg_reader->del_count();

Return the number of documents which have been marked as deleted but
not yet purged from the index.

=head2 doc_max

    $seg_reader->doc_max();

Return the maximum number of documents available to the reader, which
is also the highest possible internal document id.  Documents which
have been marked as deleted but not yet purged from the index are
included in this count.

=head2 doc_count

    $seg_reader->doc_count();

Return the number of documents available to the reader, subtracting
any that are marked as deleted.

=head2 _offsets

    $seg_reader->_offsets();

Return an array with one entry for each segment, corresponding to
segment doc_id start offset.

=head2 seg_readers

    $seg_reader->seg_readers();

Return an array of all the SegReaders represented within the
IndexReader.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Index::SegReader isa L<Lucy::Index::IndexReader> isa L<Lucy::Index::DataReader> isa Clownfish::Obj.

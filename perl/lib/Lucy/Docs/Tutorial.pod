=head1 Step-by-step introduction to Apache Lucy.

Explore Apache Lucy’s basic functionality by starting with a minimalist CGI
search app based on Lucy::Simple and transforming it, step by step,
into an “advanced search” interface utilizing more flexible core modules like
L<Indexer|Lucy::Index::Indexer> and L<IndexSearcher|Lucy::Search::IndexSearcher>.

Lucy::Simple.

classes like L<Indexer|Lucy::Index::Indexer> and
L<IndexSearcher|Lucy::Search::IndexSearcher> in place of Lucy::Simple.

L<FieldTypeTutorial|Lucy::Docs::Tutorial::FieldTypeTutorial> - Experiment with different field
characteristics using subclasses of L<FieldType|Lucy::Plan::FieldType>.

=item *

L<AnalysisTutorial|Lucy::Docs::Tutorial::AnalysisTutorial> - Examine how the choice of
L<Analyzer|Lucy::Analysis::Analyzer> subclass affects search results.

=item *

L<HighlighterTutorial|Lucy::Docs::Tutorial::HighlighterTutorial> - Augment search results with
highlighted excerpts.

=item *

L<QueryObjectsTutorial|Lucy::Docs::Tutorial::QueryObjectsTutorial> - Unlock advanced search features
by using Query objects instead of query strings.

=head2 Source materials

The source material used by the tutorial app – a multi-text-file presentation
of the United States constitution – can be found in the C<sample> directory
at the root of the Lucy distribution, along with finished indexing and search
apps.

    sample/indexer.pl        # indexing app
    sample/search.cgi        # search app
    sample/us_constitution   # corpus

=head2 Conventions

The user is expected to be familiar with OO Perl and basic CGI programming.

The code in this tutorial assumes a Unix-flavored operating system and the
Apache webserver, but will work with minor modifications on other setups.

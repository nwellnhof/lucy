=head1 NAME

Lucy::Plan::Schema - User-created specification for an inverted index.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lucy::Plan::Schema;
    use Lucy::Plan::FullTextType;
    use Lucy::Analysis::EasyAnalyzer;
    
    my $schema = Lucy::Plan::Schema->new;
    my $easyanalyzer = Lucy::Analysis::EasyAnalyzer->new(
        language => 'en',
    );
    my $type = Lucy::Plan::FullTextType->new(
        analyzer => $easyanalyzer,
    );
    $schema->spec_field( name => 'title',   type => $type );
    $schema->spec_field( name => 'content', type => $type );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Schema is a specification which indicates how other entities should
interpret the raw data in an inverted index and interact with it.

Once an actual index has been created using a particular Schema, existing
field definitions may not be changed.  However, it is possible to add new
fields during subsequent indexing sessions.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $schema = Lucy::Plan::Schema->new;

Constructor.  Takes no arguments.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 architecture

    $schema->architecture();

Factory method which creates an Architecture object for this index.

=head2 spec_field

    $schema->spec_field(
        name => $string,      # required
        type => $field_type,  # required
    );

Define the behavior of a field by associating it with a FieldType.

If this method has already been called for the supplied
C<field>, it will merely test to verify that the supplied
FieldType L<equals()|Clownfish::Obj/equals> the existing one.

=over

=item *

B<name> - The name of the field.

=item *

B<type> - A FieldType.

=back

=head2 fetch_type

    $schema->fetch_type($field);

Return the FieldType for the specified field.  If the field can’t be
found, return undef.

=head2 fetch_sim

    $schema->fetch_sim($field);
    $schema->fetch_sim();  # default: undef

Return the Similarity for the specified field, or undef if
either the field can’t be found or it isn’t associated with a
Similarity.

=head2 num_fields

    $schema->num_fields();

Return the number of fields currently defined.

=head2 all_fields

    $schema->all_fields();

Return all the Schema’s field names as an array.

=head2 get_architecture

    $schema->get_architecture();

Return the Schema instance’s internal Architecture object.

=head2 get_similarity

    $schema->get_similarity();

Return the Schema instance’s internal Similarity object.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Plan::Schema isa Clownfish::Obj.

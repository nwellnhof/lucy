=head1 NAME

Lucy::Analysis::Normalizer - Unicode normalization, case folding and accent stripping.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $normalizer = Lucy::Analysis::Normalizer->new;
    
    my $polyanalyzer = Lucy::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new(
        analyzers => [ $tokenizer, $normalizer, $stemmer ],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Normalizer is an L<Analyzer|Lucy::Analysis::Analyzer> which normalizes
tokens to one of the Unicode normalization forms. Optionally, it
performs Unicode case folding and converts accented characters to their
base character.

If you use highlighting, Normalizer should be run after tokenization
because it might add or remove characters.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $normalizer = Lucy::Analysis::Normalizer->new(
        normalization_form => 'NFKC',
        case_fold          => 1,
        strip_accents      => 0,
    );

Create a new Normalizer.

=over

=item *

B<normalization_form> - Unicode normalization form, can be one of
‘NFC’, ‘NFKC’, ‘NFD’, ‘NFKD’. Defaults to ‘NFKC’.

=item *

B<case_fold> - Perform case folding, default is true.

=item *

B<strip_accents> - Strip accents, default is false.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 transform

    $normalizer->transform($inversion);

Take a single L<Inversion|Lucy::Analysis::Inversion> as input
and returns an Inversion, either the same one (presumably transformed
in some way), or a new one.

=over

=item *

B<inversion> - An inversion.

=back

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Analysis::Normalizer isa L<Lucy::Analysis::Analyzer> isa Clownfish::Obj.

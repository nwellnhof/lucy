=head1 NAME

Lucy::Store::Folder - Abstract class representing a directory.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A “file” within a Folder might be a real file on disk – or it might be a
RAM buffer.  Similarly, Delete() might delete a file from the file system, or
a key-value pair from a hash, or something else.

The archetypal implementation of Folder,
L<FSFolder|Lucy::Store::FSFolder>, represents a directory on
the file system holding a collection of files.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Store::Folder isa Clownfish::Obj.

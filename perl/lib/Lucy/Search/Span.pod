=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::Span - An offset, a length, and a weight.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $combined_length = $upper_span->get_length
        + ( $upper_span->get_offset - $lower_span->get_offset );
    my $combined_span = Lucy::Search::Span->new(
        offset => $lower_span->get_offset,
        length => $combined_length,
    );
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Span objects store information about a span across an array of…
something. The unit is context-dependent.

Text is one possibility, in which case offset and length might be measured
in Unicode code points.  However, the Span could also refer to a span
within an array of tokens, for example – in which case the start and
offset might be measured in token positions.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $span = Lucy::Search::Span->new(
        offset => 75,     # required
        length => 7,      # required
        weight => 1.0,    # default 0.0
    );

Create a new Span.

=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::Collector - Process hits.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Collector decides what to do with the hits that a
L<Matcher|Lucy::Search::Matcher> iterates through, based on how the
abstract L<collect()|/collect> method is implemented.

Collectors operate on individual segments, but must operate within the
context of a larger collection.  Each time the collector moves to a new
segment, Set_Reader(), Set_Base() and Set_Matcher() will be called, and the
collector must take the updated information into account.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

        my %args = @_;
        $foo{$$self} = $args{foo};
        return $self;
    }

Lucy::Search::SortSpec - Specify a custom sort order for search results.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $sort_spec = Lucy::Search::SortSpec->new(
        rules => [
            Lucy::Search::SortRule->new( field => 'date' ),
            Lucy::Search::SortRule->new( type  => 'doc_id' ),
        ],
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits(
        query     => $query,
        sort_spec => $sort_spec,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, searches return results in order of relevance; SortSpec allows
you to indicate an alternate order via an array of
L<SortRules|Lucy::Search::SortRule>.

Fields you wish to sort against must be C<sortable>.

For a stable sort (important when paging through results), add a
sort-by-doc rule as the last SortRule.
